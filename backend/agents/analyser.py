        - Your response MUST be a human-readable, bulleted list.
        - Each bullet MUST include:

            ‚Ä¢ Key fact(s) (e.g., IP, open port, software version, etc.)
            ‚Ä¢ A brief reason why it‚Äôs relevant or how it could be exploited.
        - If the output indicates a logical failure (e.g., "Transfer failed", "Host seems down", "Connection refused"), you MUST report it with (‚ö†Ô∏è Failed).
        - DO NOT suggest "next steps".
        - DO NOT explain the tool or its options.
        - If there are no positive findings AND no logical failures, respond with: **No significant findings.**
